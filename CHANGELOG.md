# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.10] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Android 12 and below**: Fixed audio files not being returned by `getMediasByType({ mediaType: 'audio' })`
  - Root cause: Audio-specific columns (ALBUM, ARTIST) were being used with Files content URI where they're not available
  - Solution: Removed audio-specific column filtering when querying Files content URI for Android â‰¤ 12
  - Result: Audio files now correctly returned by `getMediasByType()` on Android 12 and below
- **Android 13 and above**: Implemented limited document access via alternative Files API approach
  - Root cause: MediaStore doesn't provide document access on Android 13+ due to scoped storage
  - Solution: Added `queryDocumentsWithSAF()` method using Files API with document mime type filtering
  - Result: `getMediasByType({ mediaType: 'document' })` now returns documents on Android 13+ (limited but functional)

### Changed
- **Audio column filtering**: Updated to only use audio-specific columns when appropriate
  - Android 13+: Uses audio columns when querying Audio content URI directly
  - Android 12-: Avoids audio columns when querying Files content URI for specific audio type
  - "All" media type: Can use audio columns for filtering on all Android versions
- **Document access strategy**: 
  - Android 12 and below: Uses MediaStore Files API (unchanged, full access)
  - Android 13 and above: Uses alternative Files API with mime type filtering (limited access)

### Added
- New `queryDocumentsWithSAF()` method for Android 13+ document access
- Enhanced column compatibility checking in `buildSelectionArgs()`
- Comprehensive logging for document query operations
- Improved error handling for document access across Android versions

### Technical Details
- Fixed `buildSelection()` method to handle audio columns correctly per Android version
- Updated `buildSelectionArgs()` method signature to include mediaType parameter
- Added proper mime type filtering for document discovery on Android 13+
- Enhanced debugging logs to track document query success/failure

### Documentation
- Updated README with corrected Android version behavior
- Fixed media type support matrix to reflect current working state
- Updated inline code comments with technical explanations
